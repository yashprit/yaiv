# YAPI Viewer (Yet Another PIcture Viewer)
A web image viewer that can be easily added to any web site. In-line picture editing is also supported. Its implementation is based solely on the canvas element of HTML5, javascript and CSS. It works in all major browsers: Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Konqueror. In addition, it offers a range of customisation options to suit the needs of any website.

YAPI Viewer displays your images into a box consisting of specific buttons for zoom/pan and rotation and sliders for brightness/contrast adjustment. It can be typically added to any HTML page in no more than 5 minutes. It has been developed by the [Hellenic National Documentation Center (EKT/NHRF)](http://www.ekt.gr) as part of an internally funded project.

You can view and test YAPI Viewer by navigating in the various digital collections of the PANDEKTIS repository, the digital repository of the National Hellenic Research Foundation containing primary sources of Greek history and culture. For example, you can check YAPI Viewer in action here, inside a collection of ancient Greek and Roman inscriptions.
